# Pizza Manager

Welcome to the Pizza Manager Application! This application allows you to create and manage your 
toppings with the Toppings Manager, and then use those toppings to create pizza masterpieces using the 
Pizza Manager!

I created this CRUD app to improve upon my web development skills, and to deepen my understanding of 
the workflow for web applications that involve REST APIs. See the [Tech Stack Used](#tech-stack-used) 
section for more information on the technologies and frameworks used.

The application is deployed to the cloud using Google Cloud, and can be accessed here:  
[Pizza Manager App](https://shining-glyph-390520.wl.r.appspot.com/)
